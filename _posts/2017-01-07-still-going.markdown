I haven't been to sleep yet, it's 7 AM. I don't know if I want to go get coffee and something to eat because it's freezing outside and I'm too tired. I spent all of yesterday finishing up my portfolio site and it's okay.

I'm so tired that I can't sleep. Spent all day doing my portfolio website with the Bulma CSS framework. It was a bitch to work with not gonna lie, but I do like how the website turned out. It doesn't feel perfect, but it's nice. I got one of my projects up. Still have to work on the others and then get those up.

Then I need to get back into Javascript studies. Took a little breather to focus on freelance stuff, so in case any opportunities come up I'll be ready. Hard to do design and development, not gonna lie, but I'd rather design it because then I can base it off of what I know I can do. That may not be that great or I should be "challenging" myself, but it is still a challenge, it's just not crazy off the wall stuff. I don't know. Rambling. Coffee. Please. I don't know, I might go. So tiredddd.
