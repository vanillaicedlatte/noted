Only two days since I wrote my first blog? It seems like forever ago... I guess that's what happens when you don't sleep hahaha. Well, I haven't become Javascript expert overnight. I have been intaking everything Javascript for the past 48 hours, and I feel that I am starting to grasp it a teensy bit better... maybe.

I actually found some really great resources for learning Javascript and best practice web development methods in general. I'm going to list them here because they're all awesome and even after first read through, I felt like I was actually learning something.

1. [Front-End Handbook](https://www.frontendhandbook.com/){:target="_blank"} - Really concise, information-packed website with chapters on all aspects of front-end development, resources for learning, tips for getting jobs, and a lot more.
2. [Front-End Guidelines](https://github.com/bendc/frontend-guidelines){:target="_blank"} - Simple Github repo with lots of best-practice web development guidelines.
3. [SoloLearn Learn Javascript App](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/JavaScript/){:target="_blank"} - This is a lightweight app that can help solidify some Javascript concepts, but you're not really going to be an expert or even close after completing it. I liked the quizzes and the smooth progression of the app, but I can't say I learned a ton. I probably will go through all of the lessons again because I can do it on my iPad from anywhere, at anytime. It can be kind of like reinforcement.
4. [LearnCode.academy](http://learncode.academy){:target="_blank"} - Probably my favorite YouTube channel for development tutorials, I go to this guy for everything. He has a great voice and goes about teaching at a perfect pace and really gets into what he's teaching. All of the rest of these links on this list are from his channel.
5. [Javascript is Weird and Awesome Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABI011EYc-avPOsk1YsMUe_){:target="_blank"} - I was excited before to learn Javascript, although a bit nervous because... programming languages. This video showed some practical uses of Javascript applied to web development that really helped connect some dots for me.
6. [2016/2017 Web Development Path MindMap](https://coggle.it/diagram/Vz9LvW8byvN0I38x){:target="_blank"} - A mind map by Learn Code showing different web development paths, and the front-end path is both concise and in-depth. There are links to his tutorials on most of the subjects.
7. [Javascript Fundamentals Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGACTDHuZtn0qoBdpzV9c327V){:target="_blank"} - Boring but necessary Javascript fundamentals, great to watch when I don't feel like coding. The more I watch, the more I start to get it.

Now if you're wondering, yes I am planning on actually DOING some Javascript and not just read and watch videos about it. I tried signing up for Javascript 30 but every time I try to watch the videos they're so slow I quit; I didn't even make it through 3 minutes of the intro video. It's a little overwhelming to find a good project-based tutorial, but I'm working on it. I want to do something like a weather app, maybe. I usually have the console open when I'm watching tutorials anyway, and this may be weird but I've started finding Javascript code I think I would use on a website and just... type them out. Like I just copy the code and type it all out. I don't know if it helps, but maybe.

I'm really just trying to immerse myself in Javascript and it's hard to translate the "fundamentals" that are in every tutorial to actually applying that to web development. How is doing math functions going to help me write a smooth scroll script? I'm getting it. Slowly. I keep saying that, but I am and I'm really getting into Javascript. So I'm just going through and reading, watching, re-reading, and re-watching all of this stuff and I also have to get some project ideas and get going with them.
