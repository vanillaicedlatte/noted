This is my personal blog where I post about literally anything I can think to post. Mostly this will involve learning web development and design, reviewing and drooling over perfumes, candles, clothes, design, interiors, etc, and random posts about anthropology and humans that I find interesting. And then just whatever else. Coffee, probably.

My name is Jamie. I have a four year old son named Liam, and in 2016 I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Anthropology. I am a front-end web developer. HTML, CSS, Sass, jQuery, CSS frameworks, I got it. Javascript I'm working on. Yes, I don't know Javascript that well and still call myself a web developer. Move along. There are a million things on my to-learn list this year, so consider this a journal of that journey, with a lot of sidetracking and distractions.

So thanks for visiting, thanks for reading. Honestly, I don't even know how you got here since I haven't told anyone about this blog, but okay. Cool, I guess.

P.S. This blog was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and the [Pure.css](http://purecss.io){:target="_blank"} framework, and I got the template from [this guy](https://github.com/martin308/left-stripe){:target="_blank"}. Easy peasy.
