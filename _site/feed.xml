        <title>Javascript/Front-End Learning Path.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Only two days since I wrote my first blog? It seems like forever ago… I guess that’s what happens when you don’t sleep hahaha. Well, I haven’t become Javascript expert overnight. I have been intaking everything Javascript for the past 48 hours, and I feel that I am starting to grasp it a teensy bit better… maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually found some really great resources for learning Javascript and best practice web development methods in general. I’m going to list them here because they’re all awesome and even after first read through, I felt like I was actually learning something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontendhandbook.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Front-End Handbook&lt;/a&gt; - Really concise, information-packed website with chapters on all aspects of front-end development, resources for learning, tips for getting jobs, and a lot more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bendc/frontend-guidelines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Front-End Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; - Simple Github repo with lots of best-practice web development guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sololearn.com/Course/JavaScript/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SoloLearn Learn Javascript App&lt;/a&gt; - This is a lightweight app that can help solidify some Javascript concepts, but you’re not really going to be an expert or even close after completing it. I liked the quizzes and the smooth progression of the app, but I can’t say I learned a ton. I probably will go through all of the lessons again because I can do it on my iPad from anywhere, at anytime. It can be kind of like reinforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://learncode.academy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LearnCode.academy&lt;/a&gt; - Probably my favorite YouTube channel for development tutorials, I go to this guy for everything. He has a great voice and goes about teaching at a perfect pace and really gets into what he’s teaching. All of the rest of these links on this list are from his channel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGABI011EYc-avPOsk1YsMUe_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Javascript is Weird and Awesome Series&lt;/a&gt; - I was excited before to learn Javascript, although a bit nervous because… programming languages. This video showed some practical uses of Javascript applied to web development that really helped connect some dots for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coggle.it/diagram/Vz9LvW8byvN0I38x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016/2017 Web Development Path MindMap&lt;/a&gt; - A mind map by Learn Code showing different web development paths, and the front-end path is both concise and in-depth. There are links to his tutorials on most of the subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoYCgNOIyGACTDHuZtn0qoBdpzV9c327V&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Javascript Fundamentals Series&lt;/a&gt; - Boring but necessary Javascript fundamentals, great to watch when I don’t feel like coding. The more I watch, the more I start to get it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’re wondering, yes I am planning on actually DOING some Javascript and not just read and watch videos about it. I tried signing up for Javascript 30 but every time I try to watch the videos they’re so slow I quit; I didn’t even make it through 3 minutes of the intro video. It’s a little overwhelming to find a good project-based tutorial, but I’m working on it. I want to do something like a weather app, maybe. I usually have the console open when I’m watching tutorials anyway, and this may be weird but I’ve started finding Javascript code I think I would use on a website and just… type them out. Like I just copy the code and type it all out. I don’t know if it helps, but maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really just trying to immerse myself in Javascript and it’s hard to translate the “fundamentals” that are in every tutorial to actually applying that to web development. How is doing math functions going to help me write a smooth scroll script? I’m getting it. Slowly. I keep saying that, but I am and I’m really getting into Javascript. So I’m just going through and reading, watching, re-reading, and re-watching all of this stuff and I also have to get some project ideas and get going with them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2017.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Three days into 2017. Thinking a lot about goals and where I would like to take myself. I graduated school in December. I don’t have a job right now. I’m doing a lot of sub-par development projects trying to pass myself off as a freelance developer. Not happy where I’m at, but I am somewhat confident about where I’ll be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think in my perfect web development career world, I would be able to spin up amazing looking websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript from scratch and then be able to utilize things like Sass, CSS frameworks, jQuery, and project managers. Utilize but not rely on. And then even be able to do some backend with like PHP or Node.js. Learning ReactJS would be cool, but it’s kind of last on my list of things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I utilize a lot of these things now but I am lacking a fundamental knowledge of a lot of things, including Javascript. My biggest weakness. I can USE Javascript, but I can’t write my own, and I don’t fully understand the Javascript I do use. Same with PHP, only worse, but at least PHP is a backend language. I should know Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I have sort of a to-learn list here for becoming a better web developer in 2017. It’s in a general order, from top priority down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn Javascript fundamentals. Be able to understand it. Be able to write my own from scratch and understand what I’m writing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write more organized code. I can get pretty messy when I’m coding. Use the right hierarchy, use labels. And do this WHILE I’m coding, so I don’t have to go back through and do it and wonder what the hell this code is even supposed to be for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solidify HTML &amp;amp; CSS knowledge. Mostly this will involve more organized coding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue utilizing Sass and learning the ins and outs of it. I love using it and try to use it with every project, so this won’t be too difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get better at GitHub and doing stuff from the terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a project manager workflow I like and use it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn ES6.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand PHP. At the least. Just understand the damn thing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get into Node.js.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If I can do all of this by the end of the year, then I might start learning ReactJS. Maybe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;!! There’s my web development to-learn list. Not too crazy, right? That’s a ton of learning though, but I am actually really looking forward to it. Honestly, if I can get numbers 1-6 down pat this year, I will be happy. I mean that’s acceptable for a full-time job somewhere, and ultimately that’s the goal. That, or freelancing… a post for another day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
